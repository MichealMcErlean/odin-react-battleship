# Battleship
## An Odin Project exercise redone in React

This is the project I've been looking forward to. I wasn't happy with the Battleships exercise I originally turned out, for multiple reasons, aesthetic and functional. A second shot with React's toolkit to help out should prove interesting. I also want to make the project more responsive, and work on two of the optional objectives: free placement for the player and better AI.
